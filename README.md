#Number Guessing Game (C++)

A simple and interactive C++ console-based Number Guessing Game developed in CLion as part of my remote internship at Rhombix Technologies.
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it. After each attempt, the program provides real-time feedback such as “Too high”, “Too low”, or “You’re close!” until the correct number is guessed.
